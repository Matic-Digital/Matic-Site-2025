Enhance TypeScript Support and Fix Loading Logic

Changes Made:
- LoadingProvider Component:
- Added proper TypeScript types for useRef and setTimeout
- Wrapped the provider in a Suspense boundary to accommodate useSearchParams
- Updated to use app router instead of pages router

- ThemeInitializer Component:
- Made defaultTheme prop required for better type safety
- Simplified the component logic to directly use the provided theme

Warnings:
- Resolved TypeScript issues, but several ESLint warnings remain regarding unused variables:
- Layout in app/layout.tsx
- CTASection, EngageSection, ThemeInitializer in app/page.tsx
- ScrollThemeTransition in JournalSection.tsx
- index in PartnershipSection.tsx

Summary:
The application is now built successfully with enhanced TypeScript support and improved loading logic. Further cleanup of unused variables is recommended to address ESLint warnings.
