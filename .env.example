# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID="your Space ID"
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN="Content Delivery API token"
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN="Content Preview API token"
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET="any URL friendly value of your choice"

# Mux - if using directly in the app
# MUX_TOKEN_ID="your Mux token ID"
# MUX_TOKEN_SECRET="your Mux token secret"
